## Template Images

Available templates:

- Blanket
- Enter
- Exit
- NotStonks
- Pet
- Sip
- Stonks

To create a template image, type `p!<template> [image/emoji/user]`

The image variable allows you to include a direct image URL (Which ends in an image format such as `.png`, `.jpg` or `.gif`) or you can use Discord's image upload tool to directly attach the image.

The emoji variable allows you to include the emoji you want to append into the image.

The user variable allows you to enter a user mention or their user ID. The bot will then append the user's profile picture into the final image.

When using the user variable, the user you mention or include their ID does not need to be in the server you're executing the command in.

You can also use any valid server ID, which the bot will then use and append the server's icon. This will work for any server in which the bot is in.
